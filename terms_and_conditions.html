            policy for UPS shipments. We can accept prepaid UPS labels provided via fax to 
            323-389-2200 or email to orders@sorbentsystems.com - we do not ship using Customer

          <p>Online orders generally take 3-5 business days to process from date of credit card confirmation. 
            To expedite your order processing time, select "same day service" for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">$25 rush fee</span>.
            <br>
            Please note: Order processing time is separate from shipping time; paying for "overnight shipping"

          <h3>Delivery</h3>
          <p>A minimum charge of at least <span style="font-weight: bold;">$25.00</span> will be applied to all rush orders. 
            (Rush orders are always processed on a " best efforts" basis.) A rush order 
            is any order processed and shipped in less than 72 business hrs. of placement.
            <br>
            - Seller's proposed delivery times are estimates only. Actual delivery and production 
            times may vary and do not constitute a breach by Seller unless the delay is unreasonable.
            <br>
            - Production and delivery schedules shall be extended if technical or commercial 
            issues remain unresolved, if any payment is not timely received by Seller in full, 
            due to acts of God or forces of nature, or in the event of circumstances beyond 
            the control of seller.
            <br>
            - Seller has no duty to commence any engineering, planning, or production until Buyer 
            executes and returns this agreement and any preliminary payment is paid in full.
            <br>
            - All international shipments will require "prepaid duty fees".
            <br>
            - If you are not charged duty fees prior to shipment, in addition to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">$25.00</span> processing fee, 
            your credit card may be charged again for the balance IMPAK Corporation incurs from the 
            shipping company. Your failure to pay the Duty (and other) Fees at the time of delivery 
            will result in a demand for payment from IMPAK Corporation and we will charge your credit 
            card for the fees and our services.
